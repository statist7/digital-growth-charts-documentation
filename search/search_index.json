For this reason, we have produced, as part of the dGC MVP, a permissively-licensed open-source React component, which aims to simplify the process of creating a chart from the chart data received from the API. It makes the job of drawing a vector-graphic centile chart much easier. https://github.com/rcpch/digital-growth-charts-react-component-library You can use the component as-is in a React app, or include it in plain HTML or any other JavaScript framework. Why React? \u00b6 Getting started \u00b6 foobar:~foo$ npm i --save @rcph/digital-growth-charts-react-component-library Victory Charts are a dependency (see below), themselves built on top of D3.js. On build it is likely you will get an error relating to circular dependencies for some files in the d3-interpolate module. The is an issue logged here . If you want to run the package locally alongside the react client, there are some extra steps to go through. Since the chart library and the react client both use react, the charts will throw an error if you import them in the package.json of your app from a folder on your local machine. For example in your react app: \"dependencies\" : { \"@rcpch/digital-growth-charts-react-component-library\" : \"file:/Users/FooBar/Development/react/component-libraries/digital-growth-charts-react-component-library\" , } The problem with this is that there are then 2 versions of react running. To overcome this, in your application: foobar:~foo$ cd node_modules/react foobar:~foo$ npm link In the root folder of your chart library: foobar:~foo$ npm link react Repeat the same for react-dom ensuring all the package versions are the same for your app and the library. In this way, you can make changes to the chart package and they will appear in your app after npm run build and refresh your app. If the invalid hooks error persists inspite of this, a further fix involves deleting the node_modules folder in the @rcpch/digital-growth-charts-react-component-library folder within node_modules in the client. Structure \u00b6 This library has been written in Typescript. The main component is RCPCHChart , which takes the following props : { title : string , subtitle : string , measurementMethod : 'height' | 'weight' | 'ofc' | 'bmi' , sex : 'male' | 'female' , measurementsArray : [ Measurement ], reference : 'uk-who' | 'turner' | 'trisomy-21' , width : number , height : number , chartStyle : ChartStyle , axisStyle : AxisStyle , gridlineStyle : GridlineStyle , centileStyle : CentileStyle , measurementStyle : MeasurementStyle } The Measurement interface is structured to reflect the JSON Measurement object which is returned by the API. The RCPCHChart component uses the reference prop to determine which chart to render. So far, 3 references are supported: UK-WHO, Turner's Syndrome and Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome). The reference data for the centiles are included in the library in plottable format in the chartdata folder. The Measurement interface structure is: interface Measurement { birth_data : { birth_date : Date , estimated_date_delivery : Date , estimated_date_delivery_string : string , gestation_weeks : number , gestation_days : number , sex : 'male' | 'female' }, child_observation_value : { measurement_method : 'height' | 'weight' | 'bmi' | 'bmi' , observation_value : number , observation_value_error : string }, measurement_dates : { chronological_calendar_age : string , chronological_decimal_age : number , clinician_decimal_age_comment : string corrected_calendar_age : string , corrected_decimal_age : number , corrected_gestational_age : { corrected_gestation_weeks : number corrected_gestation_days : number }, lay_decimal_age_comment : string , observation_date : Date }, measurement_calculated_values : { chronological_centile : number , chronological_centile_band : string , chronological_measurement_error : string , chronological_sds : number , corrected_centile : number , corrected_centile_band : string , corrected_measurement_error : string , corrected_sds : number measurement_method : 'height' | 'weight' | 'bmi' | 'ofc' , } plottable_data : { centile_data : { chronological_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number }, corrected_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number } }, sds_data : { chronological_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number }, corrected_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number } } } } ``` The styling components allow the user to customise elements of the chart: Chart styles control the chart and the tooltips ``` js interface ChartStyle { backgroundColour ?: string , width ?: number , height ?: number , padding ?: requires { left ?: number , right ?: number , top ?: number , bottom ?: number }, titleStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } subTitleStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' },, tooltipBackgroundColour ?: string , tooltipStroke ?: string , tooltipTextStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } termFill ?: string , termStroke ?: string , infoBoxFill ?: string , infoBoxStroke ?: string infoBoxTextStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } toggleButtonInactiveColour : string // relates to the toggle buttons present if age correction is necessary toggleButtonActiveColour : string toggleButtonTextColour : string } Note for the tooltips and infobox text sizes, these are strokeWidths, not point sizes as the text here is svg. Axis styles control axes and axis labels interface AxisStyle { axisStroke ?: string , axisLabelTextStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } tickLabelTextStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } } Gridline styles allow/hide gridlines and control line width, presence of dashes, colour. interface GridlineStyle { gridlines ?: boolean , stroke ?: string , strokeWidth ?: number , dashed ?: boolean } Centile styles control the width and colour. interface CentileStyle { centileStroke ?: string , centileStrokeWidth ?: number , delayedPubertyAreaFill ?: string } Measurement styles control the plotted data points - colour, size and shape. Corrected ages are always rendered as crosses. Circles for chronological ages are preferred. interface MeasurementStyle { measurementFill ?: string , measurementSize ?: number // this is an svg size } At the moment, only standard centile measurement plots are supported, but in future it is expected SDS charts will be added for all references. In time more props can be added if users request them. If you have requests, please post issues on our github or contribute. Acknowledgements \u00b6 This Typescript library was built from the starter created by Harvey Delaney The charts are built using Victory Charts for React. We tried several different chart packages for React, but we chose Victory because of their documentation and their ability to customise components. The chart data bundled in is subject to licence. If you wish to use this software, please contact the RCPCH. Background \u00b6 Why a Chart library? \u00b6 In the process of building the API, we realised that it would not be easy for developers not familiar with growth charts to produce them. Even if the API were to send all the values to render centiles and growth measurement points in plottable format (which it does), the challenge of rendering these remains complicated. For example, charts typically have 9 main centile lines (though there are other formats), each of which can be rendered as a series. However the UK-WHO chart is made of several growth references, each from different datasets, and it is a stipulation that they must not overlap - this means for the four datasets which make up UK-WHO, the developer must render 36 separate 'sections' of centile lines correctly. Even then, there are certain rules which are key, published by the RCPCH project board. These relate to usability of the charts. For example, the 50th centile should be de-emphasised. These and other rules are listed on the RCPCH Github Given the complexity, we decided to create a React component library for developers to use. We designed it to be customisable for those that wanted to use it, but also as a demonstration for developers who wanted to build the charts themselves from the ground up. If you want to see how the library is implemented, we have built a client for the RCPCHGrowth API in React, which can be found here . Why use React? \u00b6 React is a popular UI library for Javascript. It has endured well and seems like a popular choice for developers. Importantly, unlike some other Javascript frameworks which are primarily designed for Single Page Applications, React doesn't expect to have the entire webpage to itself. It can be used as a small component in any other web page, even if the main framework being used is something completely different. Tell us what you think Let us know what you think of our design decisions, on this or any other area of the dGC Project, by chatting to us on our dGC Forum What about other frameworks/UI libraries? \u00b6 If you need us to develop a charting component in a different language or framework, we may be able to do this with you or your company, however we would need to discuss the requirements and quote for this service. You should be aware that all such RCPCH-developed artefacts will also be open source. We will of course ensure that the licensing of such open source components is compatible with commercial use. Contact us To contact us for this service, email commercial@rcpch.ac.uk Contributing \u00b6 see Contributing How to contribute \u00b6 Fork the repository to your own GitHub account Set up your development environment (ideally using our instructions here for maximum compatibility with our own development environments) Note that running the chart package and react client locally will cause a conflict within react if multiple versions are running. A fix for this can be found in the react client readme.MD Ideally, you should have discussed with our team what you are proposing to change, because we can only accept pull requests where there is an accepted need for that new feature or fix. We can discuss with you how we would recommend to implement the new feature, for maximum potential 'mergeability' of your PR. Once the work is ready to show us, create a pull request on our repo, detailing what the change is and details about the fix or feature. PRs that affect any 'mission critical' part of the code will need suitable tests which we can run. We will endeavour to review and merge in a reasonable time frame, but will usually not merge straight into master, rather we will merge into an upcoming release branch.","title":"React Chart Component (stable)"},{"location":"clients/react-component/#react-chart-component-stable","text":"Although the process of obtaining a centile/SDS result from the API is very straightforward, rendering this to an actual digital growth chart graphic is quite complex, mainly because of the requirement to render the 9 curved 'centile lines' as well as plot the co-ordinates of the API result.

Once the work is ready to show us, create a pull request on our repo, detailing what the change is and details about the fix or feature. PRs that affect any 'mission critical' part of the code will need suitable tests which we can run. We will endeavour to review and merge in a reasonable time frame, but will usually not merge straight into master, rather we will merge into an upcoming release branch.","title":"How to contribute"},{"location":"clients/react-native-component/","text":"React Native Chart Component (experimental) \u00b6","title":"React Native Chart Component (experimental)"},{"location":"clients/react-native-component/#react-native-chart-component-experimental","text":"","title":"React Native Chart Component (experimental)"},{"location":"clients/react-native/","text":"React Native Client (experimental) \u00b6","title":"React Native Client (experimental)"},{"location":"clients/react-native/#react-native-client-experimental","text":"","title":"React Native Client (experimental)"},{"location":"clinician/date-age-calulations/","text":"Date and Age Calculations \u00b6 Decimal Age \u00b6 Decimal age is expressed as a decimal fraction in units of years. It is calculated as the number of days / 365.25. The extra 0.25 is to account for the leap year which comes round every 4 years. A pregnancy lasts 40 weeks (280 days). This is calculated from the date of the baby's mother's last menstrual period. In fact, from that date, ovulation occurs midway through the following cycle (on average 14 days into a 28 day cycle). This means that from conception, a pregnancy actually lasts only 266 days. Babies are considered to have been born 'term' if delivered anywhere from 37 to 42 weeks gestation (3 weeks before to 2 weeks after the due date). The due date is referred to as the Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD). Gestational Age / Post-menstrual Age \u00b6 Gestational age at birth is the gestation at which the infant was born, and represents the number of weeks (and extra days) since the last menstrual period. It is often shortened to gestational age, at birth being assumed. After delivery, the gestational age of preterm infants is often tracked by clinicians in addition to chronological age (and is sometimes referred to as post-menstrual age). Chronological Decimal Age \u00b6 This is the time elapsed since birth, in years, irrespective of the gestational age at birth. For example the chronological age at EDD, i.e. at 40 weeks gestation, of a baby born at 24 weeks gestation would be 16 weeks or (16 x 7)/365.25 = 0.31 years. Corrected Decimal Age \u00b6 This is the age of a child born preterm calculated from their due date rather than their birth date , which will be earlier than their due date. This adjusts for the immaturity of preterm babies being born early. The process is referred to as gestational age correction, and prior to digital growth charts it was a manual process. Prior to digital growth charts, the convention was to apply gestational age correction to all babies born before 37 weeks gestation. For those born at 32-36 weeks the correction was applied until the baby was 1 year old, and below 32 weeks until they were 2 years old (based on corrected rather than chronological age). Now that the correction is applied automatically by the API, the Project Board decided that it made no sense to stop the correction at arbitrary ages, and it should be applied throughout childhood. (Of course, the difference between corrected and uncorrected age becomes less apparent as the child gets older.) A further Project Board decision was to extend the gestational age correction to all children, including those born at term. This represents a departure from the previous practice of using a common reference for all term gestation babies, averaged across gestations 37-42 weeks. Now term babies, like preterm babies, are assessed using their gestational age.","title":"Date and Age Calculations"},{"location":"clinician/date-age-calulations/#date-and-age-calculations","text":"","title":"Date and Age Calculations"},{"location":"clinician/date-age-calulations/#decimal-age","text":"Decimal age is expressed as a decimal fraction in units of years.

Many EPR suppliers will have already started the process of integrating the RCPCH dGC API into their product, and we are happy to assist vendors with integration once they purchase a subscription. Q: How much do the RCPCH dGC APIs cost? \u00b6 A : The APIs themselves are run on a sustainable non-profit basis by the RCPCH, which is a charitable organisation. The aim is for modest revenues from the API to be fed back into development of future APIs and new features. Pricing tiers for the API are shortly to be published, and usually the EPR vendor or integration service would pay for this directly, however the costs are likely to be passed on to you, the customer. Pricing depends on the volume of requests that the vendor requires and the amount of support they need. The process of integrating the API into an existing EPR product is technically straightforward and the amount of work is modest. EPR suppliers may of course levy a fee for this additional integration work, however once this has been done once for a product, there should be minimal or zero additional work to roll out to other sites, so you should check whether the vendor has already deployed the dGC elsewhere.

Q: If we have a calculated centile from the API then why do we need the traditional 'curved-lines' growth charts at all? \u00b6 A : Good question. Maybe, in time, this style of chart will no longer be needed. Maybe in time they will be replaced by SDS charts, which would allow us to view height, weight, head circumference, and BMI all on one chart too! The traditional growth charts were actually a form of 'paper calculator' for the centile values.

However, another important function of the chart was to visualise trends in the growth. Our API does not do this, so there will be a need for some form of chart to visualise the trend. Initially we expect that clinical users will want to see the traditional growth chart, out of simple familiarity.

Any child born after that date should be plotted on a UK-WHO growth chart. Children born before May 11th 2009 are plotted on British 1990 (UK90) charts and subsequent measurements must be plotted using those charts. After age 4 the two charts are the same. The LMS Method \u00b6 It is now common practice to express child growth status in the form of SD scores - the number of standard deviations away from the mean (also known as a z-score). The SD score can be converted to a centile. The LMS method provides a way of obtaining normalized growth centiles from a relatively small original dataset, applying smoothing and extrapolation such that the resulting L, M and S curves contain the information to draw any centile curve, and to convert measurements (even extreme values) into exact SD scores. The growth reference is summarised by a table of LMS values at a series of ages. How the LMS method is used \u00b6 Look up in the LMS table for the relevant measurement (e.g. height) the age and sex-specific values of L, M and S for the child. If the child's age falls between the tabulated ages, use cubic interpolation to obtain values for the child's exact age. To obtain the z-score, plug the LMS values with the child's measurement into the formula: Growth References \u00b6 This is a growing list of growth references for children. These cover a number of specific medical conditions as well as a range of different physiological parameters. It will continue to be added to as the data become available. As a side-project of this work we are interested in collating an international library of growth references in computable format, which is at https://github.com/rcpch/growth-references and further details are available in that repository. If you have a reference which you would like us to add, please contact us on growth.digital@rcpch.ac.uk Gold Standard \u00b6 The preceding 'gold standard' for LMS calculation was LMS Growth , an Excel add-in written in Visual Basic by Huiqi Pan and Tim Cole (copyright Medical Research Council 2002\u201310). Results from RCPCHGrowth agree with LMS Growth to 3 decimal places, though beyond this there are discrepancies. Part of the reason for this relates to the decimal age calculation - in LMS Growth months and weeks are handled differently to RCPCHGrowth which uses the python date-utils library to calculate differences between dates. Interpolation \u00b6 The process involves the following steps: Calculate decimal age in years (age in days / 365.25, to account for leap years) Look up nearest decimal ages in the reference data and read off associated L, M and S values. Substitute L, M and S in the final equation to generate an SDS. In most situations, the decimal age of the child falls between the available decimal ages in the reference data. If that is the case, an interpolation needs to be performed on the ages either side of the child's age, and the same applied in turn to the L, M and S values associated with each of the ages below and above. Cubic Interpolation \u00b6 In most circumstances cubic interpolation is used - this involves identifying 2 ages below and 2 ages above the child's age and substitution the following equation: If t\u2080 , t\u2081 , t\u2082 , t\u2083 , y\u2080 , y\u2081 , y\u2082 , y\u2083 , are given, and t\u2080 < t\u2081 < t\u2082 < t\u2083 , t is in the range of [ t\u2081 , t\u2082 ], the cubic interpolation of y for t is: dt = ( t-t \u2081)/0.5 a\u2083 = y\u2081 y=a {0}dt^{3}+a dt^{2}+a_{2}dt+a^{3} Note: this derived formula is equivalent to the above cubic interpolation only when the age interval is 0.5. Alternatively, it is possible to use the CubicSpline function from the SciPy interpolate package, or the interpolate.splev function - details can be found in the comments in the sds_calculations.py module. In testing our findings were that the original Cole method above ran faster than the Scipy interpolate functions with the same level of accuracy. Linear Interpolation \u00b6 It is not always possible to perform cubic interpolation. Where a child's measurement falls close to a reference threshold, there may not be two ages below or above them, and in these situations linear interpolation is used. Linear interpolation requires only one decimal age below and above the child's age. Here, the interp1d function from the Scipy has been used to keep code less verbose. Reference Thresholds \u00b6 It is documented in several places how there are age thresholds for different measurements. This is either due to a lack of measurements, or an overlap in references. Because the different datasets overlap, there is a certain amount of logic throughout the functions to ensure that the correct reference is selected. The threshold are: length runs from 25 weeks to 2 years. There is overlap here where children are measured standing, not lying, and therefore 2 LMS values for the same age. The functions have a default_to_youngest_reference flag which by default is false. From 2 years, the data continues as height to 4 years where again there are 2 values. This is the join between the WHO 2006 and older UK90 data. Again here, default is to the older reference, but this can be overridded by the user if they wish. Length/Height appears as such on charts, and can be found simply as 'height' as a parameter for simplicity. weight appears as 'weight' as a parameter and is continuous from 23 weeks gestation through to 20 y for both sexes. There are overlaps as with height, between UK90 preterm, UK-WHO infant and child and again UK90 child datasets. BMI appears as 'bmi' as a paramater and is a calculated value requiring height in metres and weight in kilograms, expressed as kg/m\u00b2. Reference data for BMI are available from 2 weeks of age in the UK-WHO dataset, up to 20 years. Overlaps, as with height and weight, exist at 2 and 4 years. Head circumference is referred to as occipitofrontal circumference and appears as an 'ofc' parameter. Reference data exist for both sexes from 23 weeks gestation to 17 years in girls, and 18 years in boys. There are overlaps as above where datasets meet. Prematurity and Term \u00b6 An infant is considered premature if born below 37 weeks gestation. The limits of viability may stretch occasionally below 23 weeks, the reference data stops here. It is important to note that at this very young age reference data on length do not exist until the infant is 25 weeks gestation, or 42 weeks gestation in the case of BMI. For babies born premature, a gestation is provided in weeks and supplemental days, which together with the birth and measurement dates, can be used to calculate a corrected decimal age. Correction continues from delivery in those born premature up until their first birthday (if 33 weeks and above) or their second birthday if more premature. The reference data for these are found in the uk_who_0_20_preterm.json file. Removal of Term Dates Averaging \u00b6 The entire Term period (from 37-42 weeks gestation) used to be defined as a decimal age of exactly 0 years, and the Growth Chart Reference Group at the inception of the UK-WHO paper charts had previously stipulated that no growth data should be reported over the 2 week period after delivery in term infants. The growth chart reference data covering this Term period used to be averaged across the period, so that regardless of actual gestational age, all Term-born children were considered to be the same, for paper and PDF growth charts. However, during the development of the Digital Growth Charts, the dGC Project Board determined that since there is now evidence that there is a difference between the outcomes of children born at different extremes of the Term period, and also since the dGC makes it easy to correct for all gestational ages, that we should abolish the 'averaging' effect of the concept of Term, and simply correct all children for gestational age.

Results from RCPCHGrowth agree with LMS Growth to 3 decimal places, though beyond this there are discrepancies.

Substitute L, M and S in the final equation to generate an SDS. In most situations, the decimal age of the child falls between the available decimal ages in the reference data.

The threshold are: length runs from 25 weeks to 2 years. There is overlap here where children are measured standing, not lying, and therefore 2 LMS values for the same age. The functions have a default_to_youngest_reference flag which by default is false. From 2 years, the data continues as height to 4 years where again there are 2 values. This is the join between the WHO 2006 and older UK90 data. Again here, default is to the older reference, but this can be overridded by the user if they wish. Length/Height appears as such on charts, and can be found simply as 'height' as a parameter for simplicity. weight appears as 'weight' as a parameter and is continuous from 23 weeks gestation through to 20 y for both sexes. There are overlaps as with height, between UK90 preterm, UK-WHO infant and child and again UK90 child datasets. BMI appears as 'bmi' as a paramater and is a calculated value requiring height in metres and weight in kilograms, expressed as kg/m\u00b2. Reference data for BMI are available from 2 weeks of age in the UK-WHO dataset, up to 20 years. Overlaps, as with height and weight, exist at 2 and 4 years. Head circumference is referred to as occipitofrontal circumference and appears as an 'ofc' parameter.

For babies born premature, a gestation is provided in weeks and supplemental days, which together with the birth and measurement dates, can be used to calculate a corrected decimal age.

A large amount of documentation has been produced to guide the design and rendering of UK growth charts. The UK growth charts are made up of 4 datasets taken from 2 growth references (see clinical documentation for more detail). The UK90 preterm dataset runs from 23 weeks gestation to 42 weeks postmenstrual age as length (from 25 weeks), weight and head circumference. The WHO 2006 dataset runs from 2 weeks of age to 2 years of age as length, weight, BMI and head circumference. The WHO 2006 dataset continues as height (now measured standing) to 4 years of age The UK90 dataset picks up until 20y (head circumference to 17 in girls and 18 y in boys) Implications for charting digitally \u00b6 These datasets all overlap, and therefore when plotting them, they must be passed to charting packages as individual series. This means they will appear as discontinuous, with breaks in the lines where they meet/overlap. There is a natural step at each of these time points which must be respected. If all 4 datasets are presented 0-20y as a continuous dataset, chart packages will interpolate the gaps and the intentional 'step' will be lost. The api endpoint returns the chart data in an array of arrays. The first level array represents the 9 centiles [0.4, 2, 9 , 25, 50, 75, 91, 98, 99.6], with each centile in turn having a nested array of 4 arrays of data, one for each dataset (see below). The individual data points are reported as float values for x and y coordinates. X corresponds to decimal age, y to the measurement value of the chart requested. The chart data is only returned for the measurement method requested - if only height is supplied, only height centile data will be returned. In addition to the centile data, the growth data presented to the endpoint in the request are returned as an array of x and y values. Essential standards for rendering \u00b6 Whilst it is not essential to show the whole life course when plotting measurements against centile lines, the rendering of the centile lines and the plots must meet the following design standards. Centiles should be clearly labelled Overlap between datasets for each centile should be clearly visibile and no interpolation function should be used to attempt to link them The 0.4th, 9th, 50th, 91st and, 99.6th centiles should all be dashed lines (not dotted, not continuous) The 2nd, 25th, 75th and 98th centiles should be continuous lines (thin) Axes should be clearly labelled (Height/Length in cm, Weight in kg, body mass index in kg/m2, head circumference in cm, age in years) X axis (age in years) increments should be monthly under the age of 2 y, 3 monthly over the age of 2 years. Measurements should be to one decimal place. Centiles should be reported as integers, except if >99 or <1.

We also recognise the term 'customer'. (This is to distinguish from 'clients' by which we mean software which consumes the API, and 'developers' who are developing and improving the project by contributing) Q: Can we self-host the API? \u00b6 A : Technically yes. However there are several important considerations which we believe would more than negate any saving made. We have open sourced the API in order to align with our policy on transparency and clinical safety, however we advise that you do not self host it. Only the version deployed and managed by the RCPCH team is warranted to be correct. Clinical Safety Risk WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO SELF HOST THE SERVER FOR PRODUCTION/CLINICAL/LIVE USE. RCPCH On-Premise Hosting Service The RCPCH offers an 'on-premise' managed service which may suit some customers requiring the service to be hosted within their own data centre, or on their own cloud infrastructure. LINK TO PRICING If self hosting you would not have a warranty from RCPCH and your organisation would be liable for misconfigurations in the server leading to clinical mishap. Growth Charts are complex and in order to assure your service you are likely going to need a large amount of expensive statistical, clinical and technical consultancy. If self hosting you would require to obtain registration with the MHRA as a Medical Device. CSO Clinical Safety Management File DCB0129 and DCB0160 would apply By using the RCPCH-provided API you avoid all that requirement and use our commodity server. Q: Is entering a gestational age mandatory? \u00b6 A : Gestational age is not mandatory for the API to return a value. If it is not supplied then the child will be assumed to be born at 40 weeks and therefore for the UK-WHO charts, the standard term references will be used for calculations and charts. From a DPCHR implementer perspective, if a birth notification has not flowed into the DPCHR, suppliers will need to require parents to enter it. [DPCHR]: Digital Paediatric Child Health Record [DCB0129]: (Data Coordination Board) Standard 0129 [DCB0160]: (Data Coordination Board) Standard 0160 Q: What development effort is required to integrate this API into an app or Electronic Patient Record? \u00b6 A : Minimal development is required. The tricky stuff (calculating centiles from complex statistical tables, selecting the correct UK90 or WHO references for age, and gestational age correction) is all done for you. The data returned will be the correct centiles, which can be displayed to the user. Producing a visual \u2018growth chart\u2019 with this data on is a little more involved, however we have tried to make the process as easy as possible by building API endpoints which return the coordinate data from which to build the chart lines, and also we\u2019ve made an open source library which takes that source data and makes a chart for you. It\u2019s built in React and is MIT licensed, but if you are using another technology then you can inspect the source and use that to build your own client. We are keen to build a \u2018catalogue\u2019 of chart clients so other open source clients are very welcome and we will help you build and test them! Q: Is corrected gestational age passed back by the API, or do implementers have to calculate it? \u00b6 A : Yes, corrected age is passed back by the API, if a gestational age is included in the request. Warning The API can only correct for gestational age if a gestational age has been supplied! This correction is applied up to the corrected age of 1 year for preterm children born above 32 weeks, and to the corrected age of 2 years for preterm children born below 32 weeks, which is accepted standard practice among paediatricians. Q: Does my application need to validate inputs? \u00b6 A : The API has validation and error handling for out-of-range requests, but it is good practice for the front-end software to also reject input values that are out of range since this feedback can be shown to the user, by the application. Q: Is there a source from where we can get a list of extreme input values to use for our validation? \u00b6 A : Yes, we have included one in our source code: Validation Constants . This is what is used internally to validate API inputs and also used by the internal rcpchgrowth Python module to validate inputs to the Measurement class. Q: Would it be good enough to plot the returned centile values on a pre-prepared image of a growth chart? \u00b6 A : Maybe. It would depend on the implementation. Images of charts are definitely not good enough for calculating a centile from, although many GP software packages do it this way, it's poor practice and it's why the API needed to exist in the first place. BUT, since we are calculating the centiles for you, then the chart is only for displaying the trend. An image could be used, but we would advise against it generally. The problem with images is that it is very easy to accidentally have an offset or scaling error that means that some plotted points are in the right place, and some are not. Best practice is always to use the same vector graphic tooling to both construct the lines and plot the points, to avoid offsets/scaling inaccuracy. If you are using an image (please don't) then you must ensure you're selecting the correct one for the data you're presenting, and that the scaling and offset is not just programmed to be correct, but clinically tested to be correct!","title":"FAQs for Integrators"},{"location":"integrator/faqs-for-integrators/#faqs-for-integrators","text":"In our documentation we have used the term Integrator to refer to a person or team who is integrating the API into a product or service.

For this reason, we HIGHLY recommend that you do not self host any of our software, but instead use the hosted dGC API platform at https://dev.rcpch.ac.uk/ Definitions \u00b6 Note - Also see the RCPCH Risk Management Strategy CSO: Clinical Safety Officer - the person responsible for ensuring that the healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management System is applied to all clinical systems. The Clinical Safety Officer (CSO) for the Organisation is responsible for ensuring the safety of a healthcare IT system through the application of clinical risk management. The Clinical Safety Officer must hold a current registration with an appropriate professional body relevant to their training and experience. They also need to be suitably trained and qualified in risk management or have an understanding in principles of risk and safety as applied to healthcare IT systems. The Clinical Safety Officer ensures that the processes defined by the clinical risk management system are followed. DCB : Data Coordination Board Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management (CRM) Governance Arrangements \u00b6 The responsibility for healthcare IT CRM within the Organisation resides with the Clinical Safety Officer Organisational management of healthcare IT related risks is as per the existing management arrangements as specified in the Organisation\u2019s Risk Management Strategy. Clinical Risk Management Team Organisation Chart \u00b6 The RCPCH's team is not yet of a size that it requires an org chart to explain. Left here as a placeholder in case an org chart is needed in the future. Personnel \u00b6 Clinical Safety Officer \u00b6 Dr Marcus Baw Senior Clinical Adviser \u00b6 Dr Simon Chapman Chief Technology Officer \u00b6 Andrew Palmer Chief Executive Officer \u00b6 Overall governance for the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts project is provided not by a single individual, but by the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts Project Board, which is composed of senior leadership within the RCPCH and the most eminent clinicians in the field of Growth charts. Governance \u00b6 Governance for patient safety within the Organisation is provided through the following forums: Clinical Risk Meetings \u00b6 Clinical Safety is discussed as a fixed item on the two-weekly Sprint Planning Meeting at which the project is planned and priorities set for the next sprint of development. In the event of an urgent clinical safety issue or incident, a supplementary Clinical Risk meeting is held at the earliest possible time. Open, transparent public Issue tracking \u00b6 Open, public issue tracking ensures the widest possible reporting base, and unparalleled access to report issues compared to the majority of Health IT systems. These Issues, tracked in GitHub, directly form part of the development workflow used by the clinical and technical teams. Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Deliverables \u00b6 Clinical Risk Management File (this repository) \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish a Clinical Risk Management File (CRMF) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The purpose of the CRMF is toprovide a central repository where all safety related information pertaining to the healthcare IT system is stored and controlled. This GitHub repository contains out Clinical Risk Management File. Clinical Risk Management Plan (this document) \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish a Clinical Risk Management Plan (CRMP) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The purpose of the CRMP is to identify the clinical risk management activities that are to be undertaken and the phasing of these activities in the project lifecycle. The CRMP will also identify the resources required to discharge these clinical risk management activities. Hazard Log \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish and maintain a Hazard Log (HL) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The HL will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation document control /quality management policy [provide a reference]. Clinical Safety Case \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish and develop a Clinical Safety Case (CSC) for each safety related HIT system: RCPCH dGC Application Programming Interface RCPCH Demo React Client (not for direct clinical use) RCPCH React Component Clinical Safety Case Report \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will issue a Clinical Safety Case Report (CSCR) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The CSCR will be issued to support initial deployment and will be updated during the lifecycle of the healthcare IT system should the safety characteristics change. The CSCR will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation\u2019s document control policy [provide a reference]. The HL will be made available within the CRMF. Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Activities \u00b6 Hazard Identification \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will conduct hazard identification workshops to identify potential hazards associated with the deployment and use of our healthcare IT system. The CSO will be responsible for facilitating such workshops and ensuring attendance from the Royal College Digital Growth Charts team. Typically, representatives from the following domains will be required: Technical testing team User research and User Experience team Clinical testing team Statistical support Project Board The workshops will have minutes taken and a copy stored in the CRMF . If a healthcare IT solution is deemed not to be safety related then this decision will be formally recorded. The technical team will advise on the best mechanism for addition of new issues to the the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team's project management workflow. Where any third-party components are used to support the healthcare IT system then they will be considered in the scope of the hazard identification activities and subsequent risk assessment. Where none areused a positive declaration to this effect will be recorded in the minutes. All identified hazards will be recorded in the Hazard Log. Risk Assessment \u00b6 the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team's Health will conduct healthcare IT system risk assessment inaccordance with the Risk Management Strategy. The Hazard Log will be updated to capture the risk assessment. Risk Evaluation \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will conduct healthcare IT system risk evaluation inaccordance with the Risk Management Strategy The Hazard Log will be updated to capture the risk evaluation. Risk Control \u00b6 Where the initial risk evaluation is deemed unacceptable, further risk controls will be required. the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will manage healthcare IT system risk in accordance with the Risk Management Strategy. Details of the risk control measure and evidence of effective implementation will be captured in the Hazard Log. Deployment and Ongoing Maintenance \u00b6 To support clinical safety activities undertaken during any deployment phases of a project or programme of work the following documentation will be required to form a part of the overall approval process. Deployment of changes to any of the RCPCH dGC health IT systems follows an industry-standard pattern of 'code promotion' using a Git Branch-based strategy. New features are developed in branches specific to that feature. Following successful testing, user acceptance, and automated tests, a successful feature can be merged into the next branch 'up' which may be an 'alpha' or other nomenclature. The process of merging requires code review by nominated individuals and is a further opportunity for clinical safety review. Code in the 'live' branch is changed relatively infrequently (except for urgent security or safety updates) but the code which is promoted into 'live' wuld have by then undergone several rounds of review as it progressed through our branch promotion strategy. Incident Management \u00b6 Clinical Risk Management activities within the Organisation and thehealthcare IT programmes and services offered are completed within the corporate risk management strategy. As such, clinical safety related incidents are dealt with in a similar manner as other incident within the organisational such as financial,reputational, technical and other service impacting categories. Clinical Safety Competence and Training \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 The clinical safety activities described in this Clinical Risk Management System shall be undertaken by competent staff. Suitable training shall be undertaken by staff to maintain and expand their level of competence. Competency \u00b6 All of the staff identified in the organisation chart, shall be sufficiently competent for the roles and tasks which they are asked to undertake. Where an individual does not yet have sufficient experience or knowledge, then that person shall be monitored, and his/her work reviewed, by someone who has the necessary competence. Such supervision shall prevail until it is judged that the individual has amassed the necessary experience to undertake such tasks unsupervised. In assessing competency, the different functional roles required to fully discharge the obligations of the Clinical Risk Management System,and the necessary skills and knowledge needed for each, shall be considered. Primary functional roles may include: - Conducting discrete safety analyses (for example, a HAZOP or FFA) or defining the Hazard Risk Indicators for a particular project. Making a valid judgement on the safety tasks, activities and techniques required for a given Health Software Product in order to justify the comprehensiveness and completeness of the safety assessment and produce the safety argument with supporting evidence. Assurance of safety assessments and healthcare IT software products. Performance of safety techniques and development of the safety argument for a particular healthcare IT software product must be independent to any assurance activities for the same. Improving and refining the overall Clinical Risk Management System, for example, audit, process change, quality. Ownership and leadership, for example, ultimate safety accountability, culture change, influencing and strategic direction. The first test in establishing competency shall be at the interview stage where potential staff shall be assessed against the above representative roles and agreed job descriptions. Thereafter, competence shall be monitored through the organisation\u2019s established appraisal scheme. Any perceived deficiencies identified during the course of the work or at the appraised stage, especially during probation, shall be addressed immediately, for example, through the assignment of a competent supervisor or the provision of suitable training. All registered clinicians involved in safety roles shall, as a minimum,have completed an accredited training course. Training \u00b6 As part of the employment process and thereafter through the appraisal scheme, clinical safety personnel will undergo suitable training to develop, maintain or enhance their competency level. Such training can comprise: - \u2018on the job\u2019 training conducted under supervision - Internal training courses - Approved external training courses. All registered clinicians involved in clinical safety roles shall, as a minimum, have completed an accredited training course. Completion of any safety training shall be recorded by the individual on the annual appraisal form. Audits \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 Audits shall be undertaken to ensure that projects are adhering to thedefined safety requirements. Such audits will focus on the ClinicalSafety Team and third-party suppliers. Internal Safety Audits \u00b6 the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team shall undertake regular internal safety audits to ensure that projects undertaken within the organisation are compliant with this Clinical Risk Management System. These audits shall be conducted and recorded in accordance with the internal quality management procedure. The scope of an internal safety audit will be the formal Clinical Risk Management System and the Organisation\u2019s documentation supporting this document. Supplier Audits \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team shall undertake regular third-party supplier audits, as a minimum annually, to ensure compliance with their Clinical Risk Management System. The audit shall focus on the Clinical Risk Management System, the evidence which demonstrates its effective operation and any issues arising from the deployment of the healthcare IT products and services. The basis for the audit shall be DCB0129. Supplier audits shall be conducted in accordance with the External Safety Audit Procedure.","title":"Clinical Risk Management Plan"},{"location":"safety/clinical-safety-mgmt-file/clinical-risk-mgmt-plan/#clinical-risk-management-plan","text":"","title":"Clinical Risk Management Plan"},{"location":"safety/clinical-safety-mgmt-file/clinical-risk-mgmt-plan/#purpose","text":"The aim of the Clinical Risk Management Plan is to ensure that all of the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team involved with the development, implementation and use of healthcare IT systems are aware of the activities that are required to be undertaken to ensure patient safety is improved rather than compromised from the introduction of healthcare IT systems.

This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d.
